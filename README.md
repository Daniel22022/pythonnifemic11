Today I'm going to use the [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/)
template. It's a great template that I've used for a while. I would teach you how to use it.
Firstly , you need to install it.
```html
<a href = "https://html5boilerplate.com/">
```
Then you need to download the template.
```html
<a href = "https://html5boilerplate.com/">
```
Then you wait and do all necessary things with the templates
always remember to change your favicon

## Why Do I need to change my favicon?
The default favicon is a picture of a cat.
and who uses the internet?
